# Student Record Management System (C++)

## Overview
This project is a **console-based Student Record Management System** developed in **C++** as part of my **first semester Programming Fundamentals coursework**.  
It demonstrates core programming concepts such as arrays, functions, loops, conditionals, and basic input/output handling.

The system allows users to **add, view, search, update, and delete student records** using a simple menu-driven interface.

---

## Concepts Used
This project focuses strictly on **programming fundamentals**, without using Object-Oriented Programming.

- Arrays  
- Functions  
- Loops (`for`, `do-while`)  
- Conditional statements (`if`, `switch`)  
- Input/Output (`cin`, `cout`)  
- Basic data validation  
- Menu-driven program structure  

---

## Features
- Add student records (roll number, name, marks)  
- Prevent duplicate roll numbers  
- Display all stored student records  
- Search for a student by roll number  
- Update student marks  
- Delete a student record  
- Input validation for marks range (0–100)  

---

## Technologies
- **Language:** C++  
- **Compiler:** Any standard C++ compiler (GCC, MSVC, Clang)  
- **Paradigm:** Procedural Programming
