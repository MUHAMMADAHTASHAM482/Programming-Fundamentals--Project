Student Record Management System (C++)

Overview
This project is a console-based Student Record Management System developed in C++ as part of my first semester Programming Fundamentals coursework.
It demonstrates core programming concepts such as arrays, functions, loops, conditionals, and basic input/output handling.

The system allows users to add, view, search, update, and delete student records using a simple menu-driven interface.

Concepts Used
This project focuses strictly on programming fundamentals, without using Object-Oriented Programming.
Arrays
Functions
Loops (for, do-while)
Conditional statements (if, switch)
Input/Output (cin, cout)
Basic data validation
Menu-driven program structure

Features
Add student records (roll number, name, marks)
Prevent duplicate roll numbers
Display all stored student records
Search for a student by roll number
Update student marks
Delete a student record
Input validation for marks range (0–100)

Technologies
Language: C++
Compiler: Any standard C++ compiler (GCC, MSVC, Clang)
Paradigm: Procedural Programming

How to Run
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-record-management-system.git
Compile the program:
g++ main.cpp -o student_system

Run the executable:
./student_system
